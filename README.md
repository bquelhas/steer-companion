# Steer — Android companion app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project has moved.** The Android companion now lives in the
> **Pebble Steer** monorepo alongside the watchapp:
> **https://github.com/bquelhas/steer** (`android/` directory).
> This standalone repository is kept only for history and is no longer updated.

Steer's phone half. It reads turn-by-turn navigation from your map app's
notifications and forwards each maneuver to a **Pebble** watch running the
[Steer watchapp](https://github.com/bquelhas/steer): next-turn icon,
distance, street/instruction, ETA and an over-limit speed alert.

- **Package / app id:** `com.bquelhas.navme` (display name "Steer").
- **Min SDK 24**, Material You (dynamic colours, follows system theme).
- **Interface** in English or Portuguese (chosen from the device language).
- **Licence:** MIT (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)); attribution in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

### Compatible navigation apps

Turn-by-turn guidance is read from **Google Maps**, **OsmAnd** (Play and
free/F-Droid builds), **CoMaps** and **Organic Maps**. Waze can be *launched*
to a favourite, but its notifications don't expose the maneuver, so a live Waze
route can't be mirrored to the watch.

### Planned / in progress

- On-watch speedometer (the speed-limit alert already works).
- Launching a favourite destination directly from the watch.

## How it works

```
Map app (Google Maps, …)
    │  posts a navigation notification
    ▼
NavNotificationListenerService     ← requires "Notification access" permission
    │  NaviParser: extract distance / street / maneuver icon, normalise units
    ▼
PebbleEmitter                       ← PebbleKit CLASSIC (not PebbleKit 2)
    │  AppMessage keyed by NavKeys (mirrors the watch's package.json messageKeys)
    ▼
Steer watchapp on the Pebble
```

Key pieces (all under `app/src/main/java/com/bquelhas/navme/`):

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `NavNotificationListenerService.kt` | Listens to nav notifications, drives the pipeline |
| `NaviParser.kt` | Parses distance/street from notification text; metric/imperial units |
| `ManeuverClassifier.kt` / `ManeuverFingerprints.kt` | Classifies a maneuver from the notification's icon |
| `PebbleEmitter.kt` | Sends AppMessages to the watch (classic PebbleKit) |
| `NavKeys.kt` | Message-key constants — must match the watch's `package.json` |
| `SpeedProvider.kt` | GPS speed for the watch speedometer / speed alert |
| `Favorites*.kt`, `NavLauncher.kt`, `WatchCommandReceiver.kt` | Favourite destinations + launch-from-watch |
| `DeveloperActivity.kt`, `MockNav*`, `DebugCycler.kt` | Debug tools (gated behind a master switch) |
| `PbwInstaller.kt` | Installs the bundled watchapp `.pbw` onto the watch |

### Why PebbleKit *classic* and not PebbleKit 2

On the Core Devices app, PebbleKit 2's `sendDataToPebble` fails with
`FailedDifferentAppOpen` whenever the app it tracks as "active" isn't our UUID,
and `startAppOnTheWatch` only flips that registration without actually focusing
the app — a deadlock. The classic PebbleKit path
(`PebbleKit.sendDataToPebble` / `startAppOnPebble`) works reliably. Keep using
it.

## Building

Requires a JDK **with a compiler** (`javac`). The system `java-21` on the
original dev machine was JRE-only; Android Studio's bundled JBR works:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/a/jdk-with-javac      # e.g. Android Studio's jbr
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Install to a phone (wireless adb example):

```sh
adb connect <phone-ip>:<port>
adb -s <phone-ip>:<port> install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Bundling the watchapp into the APK

The APK can ship the watch build so users install both together. The
`bundleWatchPbw` Gradle task copies the watch's compiled `.pbw` into
`app/src/main/assets/steer.pbw` before assets are merged. It looks for the
watch project as a **sibling checkout**:

```
../../projetos/Nav-app/build/Nav-app.pbw     (relative to this repo)
```

Adjust that path in `app/build.gradle.kts` to wherever you cloned the
[watch repo](https://github.com/bquelhas/steer), run `pebble build`
there, then rebuild the APK. If the `.pbw` is absent the task is skipped and
the "install watchapp" button simply reports it's not bundled — the phone app
still builds and runs.

## First run

1. Grant **Notification access** (the app shows a setup card until you do).
2. Grant **Location** if you want the speedometer / speed alert.
3. Pair a Pebble via the Pebble / Core Devices app and start navigating.

## What's **not** in this repo

- `app/src/main/assets/steer.pbw` — build artifact (regenerate as above).
- `app/src/debug/assets/gmaps_maneuvers/` — Google Maps' own maneuver artwork,
  used only by the debug MockNav auditing tool. Not redistributed. Without it,
  that debug tool degrades gracefully.

Code and comments in English. If you change the phone↔watch protocol, update
`NavKeys.kt` **and** the watch's `package.json` in lock-step. See
